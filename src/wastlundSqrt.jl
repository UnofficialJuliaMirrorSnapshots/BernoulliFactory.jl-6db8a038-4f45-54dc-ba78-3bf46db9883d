## A modified version of the algorithm (attributed to S. Vempala) in
## WÃ¤stlund, J., 1999. Functions arising by coin flipping. Technical Report,
## KTH, Stockholm.
##
## Specifically, I modified the algorithm so that the calls to f() and the
## sampling of the Bernoulli r.v.s occurs in tandem, so as to avoid the
## infinite expected running time of the initial pass of the original algorithm.
##
## This is also more efficient in terms of calls to f() than the version
## described in
## Flajolet, P., Pelletier, M. and Soria, M., 2011, January. On Buffon machines
## and numbers. In Proc. 22nd ACM-SIAM symposium on Discrete algorithms.
